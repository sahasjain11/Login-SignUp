High-End Authentication Suite (Frontend Simulation)
This project features a high-end, ultra-modern, glassmorphism-themed authentication flow built entirely with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. It is designed to simulate a secure login process that includes mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) before granting access to a dashboard.

Note: This is a purely front-end simulation. All authentication logic, user profile persistence, and API calls are mocked using React state and JavaScript setTimeout. No actual backend or database connection is required or used in this version.

Features
Modern UI/UX: Dark-mode, glassmorphism design for a futuristic feel.

Complete Flow: Implements Login, Register, Forgot Password, and a mandatory MFA step.

Mock Session Management: Simulates successful authentication and mock user data display.

Fully Responsive: Optimized for both mobile and desktop screens using Tailwind's utility-first approach.

Dependencies: Uses lucide-react for high-quality, modern icons.

Project Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (version 16 or higher)

npm or yarn

Steps
Initialize the Project:
Start by creating a new React project (e.g., using Vite or Create React App) or use an existing one. For a quick start, assuming you are using create-react-app:

npx create-react-app high-end-auth-suite --template cra-template-pwa-typescript
cd high-end-auth-suite

Install Dependencies:
Install the core dependencies listed in the provided package.json (React, lucide-react, and Tailwind utilities):

npm install react react-dom lucide-react react-scripts web-vitals
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

Configure Tailwind CSS:
Generate the tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js files:

npx tailwindcss init -p

Update your tailwind.config.js to include React files:

// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

Integrate Tailwind in CSS:
Add the Tailwind directives to your main CSS file (e.g., src/index.css):

/* src/index.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Add the Inter font if needed, though Tailwind CDN usually handles it in Canvas */
@import url('[https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100..900&display=swap](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100..900&display=swap)');

Add the Application Code:
Replace the content of your main application file (e.g., src/App.jsx or src/App.tsx) with the content of the AuthSuite.jsx component provided in the Canvas.

Run the Application:

npm start

The application will open in your browser, and you can test the high-end, mock authentication flow.
